! DID NOT INSTALL JAVA

The Oracle JDK License has changed for releases starting April 16, 2019.

The new Oracle Technology Network License Agreement for Oracle Java SE is substantially different from prior Oracle JDK licenses. The new license permits certain uses, such as personal use and development use, at no cost -- but other uses authorized under prior Oracle JDK licenses may no longer be available. Please review the terms carefully before downloading and using this product. An FAQ is available here: https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/overview/oracle-jdk-faqs.html

Oracle Java downloads now require logging in to an Oracle account to download Java updates, like the latest Oracle Java 8u211 / Java SE 8u212. Because of this I cannot update the PPA with the latest Java (and the old links were broken by Oracle).

For this reason, THIS PPA IS DISCONTINUED.

For Oracle Java 11, see a different PPA -> https://www.linuxuprising.com/2019/06/new-oracle-java-11-installer-for-ubuntu.html

That same PPA also has Oracle Java 13 -> https://www.linuxuprising.com/2019/09/install-oracle-java-13-on-ubuntu-linux.html

QUESTIONS:
* .svg: it is an image file but what is it? How are they generated?
	- like .png
* JSX?: what is it? 
	- to produce React elements
* components: are css and javascript mixed in React?
	- they defined stylesheet at the bottom of its component file
* constants: 
	 - basically global constants
* navigation:
	- how components links and pass info to other objects
* redux: I have heard of it, but what is it exactly
	- REACT: views, objects, rerender, when rerender
	- REDUX: how to handle state, bind state to views, 
		- boilerplate heavy, decoupling/decomposing state
		- reducers: functions that modify state and rerender state
		- cascading complexity
* immutable js
	- identity comparision are value comparisons
	- Immutable is a JavaScript library implementing persistent data structures. It is performant and has an idiomatic JavaScript API.
	- Immutable and most similar libraries are orthogonal to Redux. Feel free to use them together!
* CONTRIBUTING.md
	- set plogalong as upstream
	- where is my origin
