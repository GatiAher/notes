@ Visualization

* HoloViews 
	- Lets you build data structures that are conducive to visualization. Once you move your data into a HoloView Container object, such as a GridMatrix for multi-variate analysis or a Layout for displaying components next to each other, you can explore the data visually. 
	- Plotting happens separately on the matplotlib or Bokeh backends, so you can focus on the data, not writing plotting code.
	- When using the Bokeh backend, you can combine the slider component with Bokeh's tools for exploring plots, like zooming and panning.
	- HoloViews integrates with Seaborn and pandas, opening up the power of pandas DataFrames and Seaborn's statistical charts.
